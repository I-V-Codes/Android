Test Apps
=================

In this folder we will add any apps we use for testing. Any of these apps will either be implemented into our final app or just be left here to collect dust. Most of these are tutorials that we took from online that we edited for our own use.

((To be added-----
  * JSONParser App
    * used to grab a table in JSON format from a google docs spreadsheet.
  * XMLParser App
    * might not actually be in this folder, but we want to play around with an XML parser to get data from the spreadsheet, going to figure out which might be more practical
  * Some app dealing with Fragments/Activities
    * we want to make the code a little bit neater, reduce the number of Activities, support for bigger screens/orientations

    * same link in JSON format
